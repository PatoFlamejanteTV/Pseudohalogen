For building this, you gonna need:

Visual Studio (NOT "CODE"), i recommend the most recent one
Some SDKs i think (don't worry, i'm not sure bout that)

Step-by-step:

Double-click "Pseudohalogen-safety.sln" > Its an file that informs VS how to compile,
Click "Build"
And click select "Pseudohalogen-safety"

Now search for "x64" or anything else and test :D

You can also just change options at config.ini and rebuild.

EXAMPLE

; Test config file for ini_example.c and INIReaderTest.cpp

[main]
ignorewarnings = false    ; dont display the "this is harmless" warnings
undertalesfx = true       ; when opening and when ending
windowsspam = true        ; open some random harmless windows

---
Normally, you WANT GIVE USERS A WARNING, but if not, you can adjust.

; Test config file for ini_example.c and INIReaderTest.cpp

[main]
ignorewarnings = true    ; dont display the "this is harmless" warnings
undertalesfx = true       ; when opening and when ending
windowsspam = true        ; open some random harmless windows

---
If your OS is older enough to dont open some System32 Windows, you adjust
that too.

; Test config file for ini_example.c and INIReaderTest.cpp

[main]
ignorewarnings = false    ; dont display the "this is harmless" warnings
undertalesfx = true       ; when opening and when ending
