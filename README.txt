If you don't know what is the Pseudohalogen.exe file do, then
do not run, and delete the file. This program is not a malware.
And this will not destroy your system

WARNING:
If you have something that hurts your eyes
such as epilepsy, then DO NOT RUN THIS MALWARE!

Version: 1.2
Written in: C++ [Holzer], HTML/JS & BatchFile [Pseudohalogen].
(Written on C too, but the C code are just very very small snnipets of code)

This little trojan will create some GDI effects, open programs,
some ByteBeat and at the end.

Before the (disabled) destruction begins, there's 2 warnings, so
nothing will happen when running by an accident.
User Account Control will also appear in Windows Vista and newer.
Without admin privileges, it won't be able to overwrite the MBR. So
be sure to run as admin (it will run as admin by default)! On Windows XP
you can just run it, it will can overwrite in anyway.

Only try this in a Virtual Machine. (actually you can use your normal PC too)

There's a bug that it will stop because the ByteBeat code
is coded wrongly, I am trying to fix that as soon as possible
but I'm not a big C++ brain.

I made this trojan only for educational purposes!

DISCLAIMER:
I am not responsible for any damage
made to your computer.

Note: If the effects are slow, then try it in Windows XP.
